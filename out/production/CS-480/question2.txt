NOTE: I chose puzzles that I completed by hand and made sure they weren't too complex, this was done to make sure that
my computer could handle the computation and not wanting to take up too much time. It should be noted that these
algorithms will work for more complex puzzles, just take more time. Regardless of that, it can be seen below that the A*
search easily clears the BFS and DFID as expected, and in some cases, even taking 0.000 seconds. If you were to run the
q2.java file, you should get very similar output. The Puzzle class contains my custom Puzzle class, which is a
LinkedHashMap (to maintain insertion order), with the key of a custom Tuple (Tuple.java) and a value of Object, an
integer for our example.

Average time taken for BFS: ~0.035 seconds
Average time taken for A* search: ~0.001 seconds
